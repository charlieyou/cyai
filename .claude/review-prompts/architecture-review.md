## Evaluation Criteria (Architecture Review)

Review this architecture analysis for:
1. **Insight Quality** - Are observations genuinely architectural (not just code style)?
2. **Leverage** - Do recommendations target high-impact structural changes?
3. **Feasibility** - Are suggested refactors practical given constraints?
4. **Trade-offs** - Are architectural trade-offs acknowledged?
5. **Boundaries** - Are module/layer boundaries correctly identified?
6. **Dependency Analysis** - Is the dependency graph analysis sound?

Focus on whether this review would improve system design, not just code quality.
