## Evaluation Criteria (Implementation Plan)

Review this implementation plan for:
1. **Completeness** - Does it cover all necessary changes? Missing files or steps?
2. **Correctness** - Are the proposed modifications technically sound?
3. **Order of Operations** - Are steps sequenced correctly (dependencies first)?
4. **Edge Cases** - Are error paths, fallbacks, and corner cases addressed?
5. **Breaking Changes** - Are backwards compatibility concerns identified?
6. **Testability** - Can the implementation be verified? Are test steps included?
7. **Scope Creep** - Does it stick to what's needed, or introduce unnecessary changes?

Focus on whether following this plan would produce a working implementation.
