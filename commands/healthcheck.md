# Code Health Check (AI-Generated Codebases)

This command runs a multi-model healthcheck where Codex and Gemini independently analyze the codebase, then you synthesize their findings into a single artifact.

## Step 1: Run Generators

Use the Bash tool to run the generator command. This spawns Codex and Gemini to analyze the codebase in parallel:

```bash
~/.local/bin/review-gate generate --type=healthcheck
```

This will output drafts from both models. Wait for it to complete (may take several minutes).

## Step 2: Synthesize the Drafts

After receiving the generator output, synthesize the drafts into a single coherent healthcheck artifact:

1. **Identify common findings** - Issues flagged by both models are likely real
2. **Resolve conflicts** - When models disagree, use your judgment to pick the correct assessment
3. **Deduplicate** - Merge similar issues into single entries
4. **Structure the output** - Follow the format below

## Step 3: Write the Artifact

Get the artifact path:
```bash
~/.local/bin/review-gate artifact-path
```

Then write the synthesized healthcheck to that path.

## Output Format

Start the artifact with the review-type marker (required for review gate):
```
<!-- review-type: healthcheck -->
```

Include a short **Method** block (3-6 bullets) noting that this was synthesized from multiple model analyses.

Then produce a **single unified list** of issues, sorted by severity (Critical first, then High, Medium, Low).

For each issue:

```
### [Severity] Short title

**Primary files**: `path/to/file.ts:lines`
**Category**: Correctness | Dead Code | AI Smell | Structure | Hygiene | Config Drift
**Type**: bug | task | chore
**Confidence**: High | Medium | Low
**Context**:
- What's wrong (1 sentence)
- Why it matters (1-2 sentences)
**Fix**: Concrete action to resolve (1-3 sentences)
**Acceptance Criteria**: 1-3 bullets
**Test Plan**: 1-2 bullets
```

## Severity Definitions

- **Critical**: Would cause data loss, security breach, or crash in production
- **High**: Will cause bugs under realistic conditions
- **Medium**: Correct but hard to maintain. Creates drag but doesn't break things
- **Low**: Style, naming, minor inconsistency

---

## Priority Order

When synthesizing, prioritize:

1. **Correctness & data integrity** - bugs, edge cases, unsafe behavior
2. **Delete & simplify** - dead code, unused abstractions
3. **Consistency & clarity** - same problem → same pattern
4. **Tests** - critical flows must be tested
5. **Performance** - only where there's a problem

> **Note**: The review gate stop hook will automatically evaluate your artifact once written.
