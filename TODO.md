# TODO

1. Tune modes of intelligence (low/med/high) that use different reasoning levels/models
2. Add command arg to configure max iterations (e.g., `--iterations 3`)
3. Allow Claude to inject comments on specific review items (e.g., mark as N/A or false positive with explanation)
4. code review mode that does not fix the code, iterates on the review itself
